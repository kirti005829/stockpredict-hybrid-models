# stock-predict-ml-mixmodels
## 📊 Project Overview

This project focuses on forecasting stock market prices using a combination of classical and deep learning models:

- **ARIMA**
- **SARIMA**
- **Facebook Prophet**
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory Neural Network)**

The aim is to compare performance across different model types and identify the best fit for time series forecasting.

## 🧠 Models Used

- **ARIMA & SARIMA**: Statistical models for univariate time series forecasting.
- **Facebook Prophet**: Robust to missing data and trend shifts.
- **LSTM**: Deep learning-based model suitable for sequential data.
